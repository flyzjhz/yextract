Purpose

This utility parses youtube links and provides a direct link to the media
stream. It was inspired by quvi, a much larger utility (and library) for
extracting media urls from various flash video websites. Unlike quvi this
utility only supports (and at the moment only plans to support) youtube links.
Futhermore it only has one dependency.

Compilation/Installation

To compile simply type "make", to install simply type "make install"

Dependencies

Libcurl is the only dependency required for successful compilation
